# The Game of Life 
A C++ implementation of the cellular automaton devised by
the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The graphical part was made up with the help of SFML library.
In the begging you can create life by clicking on cells, 
then you should press 'Space' button for the simulation to begin.

After pressing 'Space' again, you reenter in the life creating phase.

The 'Life' rules are:
 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
 - Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
 - All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
